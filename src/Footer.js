        <p style={{lineHeight: 1.6}}>
My family immigrated to America when I was 10 years old, and I spoke no English.  I studied every day, motivated by the need to understand what was going on around me.  My dictionary-reading paid off and half a year later, I was deemed "fluent enough".  I was able to read most grade-school books by then, but the Harry Potter series eluded me; I had checked out <em>Sorcererâ€™s Stone</em> many times, but found it too difficult every time.

When <em>Goblet of Fire</em> came out that summer, my parents came back from Costco with the hardcover. Money was still tight in our household back then, and I had never owned such a beautiful book; I was touched and determined to get through the whole book.  When I did, I was ecstatic.  I binged the first three books, and was proud when I joined my first Harry Potter conversation.

I have only good memories associated with Harry Potter, from that first hardcover (my parents made it a tradition to buy me every hardcover since), to the 3am screenings with my college floormates, to the full-theatre standing ovation as the credits rolled on the final film.  Itâ€™s given me a whole other world to daydream about, and a sense of belonging in this one.
